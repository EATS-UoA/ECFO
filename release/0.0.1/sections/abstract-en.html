0.0.1 release of the Emission Conversion Factor Ontology
					With the Net Zero agenda gaining significant traction across the world, organisations are often required to report carbon emissions associated with their operation. However, calculating emissions is a non-trivial task and reported scores can differ depending on the choices made by those performing the calculations or the software used to assist with this task. Emission conversion factors are used to calculate greenhouse emissions for different business operations. This ontology aims to describe these conversion factors and their associated properties (e.g., origin, applicable location, etc.) to enhance the transparency of the carbon footprint calculations.</span>
