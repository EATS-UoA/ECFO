<span class="markdown">
  The next figure shows an overview of the ECFO ontology. ECFO considers Emission Conversion Factors as first class citizens, describing them with rich metadata and provenance.

  A conversion factor has an emission source (e.g., burning a gaseous fuel like Butane), which is measured with the ecfo:hasSourceUnit property. Similarly, the ecfo:hasEmissionTarget
  describes the chemical compund released by the emission (units are captured with ecfo:hasTargetUnit). Units are represented using the quedt ontology. ECFs also have applicable periods
  (e.g., year 2019), a scope (see scope definitions below) and an applicable location (e.g., the UK). We also annotate ECFs with the dc:publisher responsible for their publication, and
  the source of data used to obtain the value in the KG (prov:wasDerivedFrom). All ECFs have a value, captured through rdf:value. Finally the ecfo:Tags may be associated with categories
  aimed at helping finding the source of an emission factor.
