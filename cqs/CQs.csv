1,"What other compatible conversion factors (e.g., from previous years, different countries) can be used in this emission calculation for this activity?","ecfo:EmissionConversionFactor, ecfo:hasCategory, ecfo:hasSourceQuantity, ecfo:hasScope, ecfo:targetUnit","We need both the quantity kind and the category due to how the data is being modeled in the UK (l1, l2 and l3 categories)"
2,"What entity (e.g, refrigerator, herd of animals), was used to transform inputs into emissions?","ecfo:hasEmissionProducer, ecfo:EmissionGenerationActivity, prov:Entity","Emission producer links the generationActivity with the sources of material, animal, etc., we are interested in."
3,"What conversion factors can I use to report emissions for my activity for this specific location and time period (ie.., so the conversion factors exist)?","ecfo:validFrom, ecfo:validTo, ecfo:applicableLocation, ecfo:scope, qudt:quantityKind, qud:unit, ecfo:emissionSource",emissionSource links ecfo:EmissionGenerationActivity with emissionCalculationEntity
4,What is the applicable geolocation of this conversion factor?,ecfo:applicableLocation,
5,What are the source and target unit from a conversion factor?,"ecfo:SourceUnit, ecfo:TargetUnit",
