# ECFO - Emission Conversion Factors Ontology <img src="Logo ECFO.svg" width=30/>
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/566369718.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/566369718)

With the Net Zero agenda gaining significant traction across the world, organisations are often required to report carbon emissions associated with their operation.
However, calculating emissions is not a trivial task and reported scores can differ depending on the choices made by those performing the calculations or the software used to assist with this task.

The aim of this ontology is to formalise emission conversion factors, in order to make the process of emissions calculations more transparent.

## Getting Started

This ontology is available at [https://w3id.org/ecfo#](https://w3id.org/ecfo#) with content negotiation in RDF/XML, TTL, JSON-LD and N-Triples.

To download the ontology in different serializations, you can use a curl command like:

```
curl -sH "Accept:text/turtle" -L https://w3id.org/ecfo#
```

To see the documentation of the ontology, just open its URI on a browser.

## Versioning

ECFO uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).
All ontology releases have their own URI.
For example, version 0.0.1 is available at [https://w3id/ecfo/0.0.1](https://w3id.org/ecfo/0.0.1):

[https://w3id.org/ecfo#](https://w3id.org/ecfo#) redirects to the last available version.
